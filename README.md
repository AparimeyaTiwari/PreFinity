# ðŸ›’ Personalized Smart Cart Recommender

**Team Project | Walmart Sparkathon**

Welcome to our Personalization Tool â€” a hybrid recommendation engine built using **Neo4j Knowledge Graphs**, fuzzy matching, and smart user profiling. Our solution enables seamless, intelligent product recommendations, auto-populated carts, and optimized in-store navigation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Our tool automatically **recommends and adds products to a user's cart** based on their personal preferences. The moment a user logs in and completes a short quiz, our system constructs a personalized profile and uses it to curate their shopping experience.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1. **User Quiz & Profile Generation**
- On login, users take a quiz.
- We extract 4 key personalization parameters:
  - **Brand Loyalty**
  - **Price Sensitivity**
  - **Health Consciousness**
  - **Adventurousness**
- These traits are stored in the **User Node** in a Neo4j Knowledge Graph.

### 2. **Knowledge Graph Structure**
- The graph has interconnected nodes:
  - `User` â†’ `Traits`
  - `User` â†’ `Likes` â†’ `Brands`
  - `User` â†’ `Purchased` â†’ `Products`
  - `Products` â†’ `Belongs_To` â†’ `Category`
  - `Products` â†’ `Located_At` â†’ `Aisle`
- We log interactions such as:
  - Views
  - Purchases
  - Brand affinity

### 3. **Recommendation Pipeline**
- Input: JSON with product name and category.
- Steps:
  1. **Fuzzy Match** product name in the selected category.
  2. Filter by userâ€™s purchase history (if a product is bought >5 times, we recommend that).
  3. If not, we rank and apply trait filters:
     - Sort personalization parameters (brand, price, health).
     - Sequentially filter products by each trait.
     - Use **Adventurousness** to decide between known and new items.
  4. **Final recommendation is added to the userâ€™s cart**.

### 4. **Smart In-Store Navigation**
- If user chooses in-store pickup:
  - Product aisle locations are included.
  - Aisles are sorted for efficient path planning.
  - Reduces store time and budget overspend.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- **User Clustering** (based on age, region, preferences) for even smarter suggestions.
- **Real-Time Notifications** for new or on-sale items users might love.
- **Auto-Cart Integration** with Walmartâ€™s system via APIs.
- Support for **image or natural language input** to trigger cart recommendations.
